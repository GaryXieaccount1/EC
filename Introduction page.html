 		<li>The meaning of Unemployment</li>
 		<fieldset>
 		Unemployment even affects those who are still employed. When workers are let go, it increases the amount of work those who are still employed have to cover. And because unemployment usually increases when companies are trying to cut costs, those expected to pick up the slack are not receiving any additional compensation for extra hours worked. Unemployment can also have a negative mental effect on those who are still working. They may become more concerned about losing their own jobs or be hesitant to look for something better because they "are lucky" to be employed at all. They may even feel guilty about having a job when their co-workers are out of work.

 		<li> How trade affect us</li>
 		<fieldset>
 		Cargill’s business is feeding a hungry world. That means that food must be able to move to where it is needed, when it is needed—across countries, continents and oceans.To accomplish this, we need access to an unrestricted, open trading system that connects all members of the world community. Using that system of trade, we can provide communities around the world with a dependable, affordable and nutritious food supply.
 		<p>But trade isn’t just about food. Open trade also allows nations to reach across borders to obtain other goods, services, new technologies and other resources they need to prosper. Most often these are resources which are not available or feasible to cultivate, manufacture or otherwise obtain internally. They may range from raw materials to factory machinery to finished products and other resources.</p>

 		<li>the power behind interest rate</li>
 		<fieldset>
 		<p>Interest rates matter in many different ways that affect the U.S. economy. One way that interest rates matter is they influence borrowing costs. Lower interest rates, for example, would encourage more people to obtain a mortgage for a new home or to borrow money for an automobile or for home improvement. Lower rates also would encourage businesses to borrow funds to invest in expansion such as purchasing new equipment, updating plants, or hiring more workers. Higher interest rates would restrain such borrowing by consumers and businesses.</p>
 		<p> Basically, the interest rate is essential to the global market and stability of the economy.</p>
