	<h1 align="center">Interest rates</h1>
	<img src="interest rate2.jpg" >
	<p>The interest rate is the amount a lender charges for the use of assets expressed as a percentage of the principal. The interest rate is typically noted on an annual basis known as the annual percentage rate (APR). The assets borrowed could include cash, consumer goods, or large assets such as a vehicle or building.</p>

	<h3 align="left"> The implication of lifting the interest rate</h3>
	<ol start="1" type="1"><li><strong>Increases the cost of borrowing</strong></li>. 
	<p>With higher interest rates, interest payments on credit cards and loans are more expensive. Therefore this discourages people from borrowing and spending. People who already have loans will have less disposable income because they spend more on interest payments. Therefore other areas of consumption will fall.</p>
	
	<li><strong>Increase in mortgage interest payments.</strong></li>
	<p> Related to the first point is the fact that interest payments on variable mortgages will increase. This will have a significant impact on consumer spending. This is because a 0. 5% increase in interest rates can increase the cost of a £100,000 mortgage by £60 per month. This is a significant impact on personal discretionary income.</p>
	
	<li><strong>Increased incentive to save rather than spend.</strong></li>
	<p>
	 Higher interest rates make it more attractive to save in a deposit account because of the interest gained.
	</p>
	
	<li><strong>Higher interest rates increase the value of a currency</strong> </li>
	<p>(due to hot money flows. Investors are more likely to save in British banks if UK rates are higher than other countries) A stronger Pound makes UK exports less competitive &#8211; reducing exports and increasing imports. This has the effect of reducing aggregate demand in the economy.
