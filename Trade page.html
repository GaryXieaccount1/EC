	<p><strong>1) Availability.</strong> Whether a specific fruit or vegetable is in season in the U.S. doesn’t matter now like it used to. I can walk into the grocery store almost any time of year and buy grapes, avocados, lettuce and tomatoes. Our trade with foreign countries allows stores here to ensure that availability.</p>
	
	<p><strong>2) Variety</strong>. There are some foods that simply don’t grow well in our climates, but they thrive elsewhere. Trade enables us to enjoy the fruits of our world neighbors’ labor.</p>
	
	<p><strong>3) Money.</strong> Free trade is a driver of the Texas and American economies. In 1993, the U.S. exported $8.9 billion to Mexico and Canada. After years under NAFTA, in 2016, American farmers, ranchers and companies exported $38 billion in goods to Mexico and Canada. That money spurs growth in our economy.</p>
	
	<p><strong>4) Volume.</strong> America produces more than we consume of some products. But we don’t produce enough of others. So we trade to ensure U.S. families are able to buy what they need.</p>
	
	<p><strong>5) Standards.</strong> Trade deals like NAFTA establish standards for what we buy. There’s a foundation of rules people must meet in order to trade their goods into the U.S. It keeps us safe.</p>
