	 <h2>The nature of economics</h2>	
	<p>
	Economics is the scientific study of the <em>ownership, use, 
	and exchange of scarce resources -</em> often shortened to the <em>science 
	of scarcity</em>. Economics is regarded as a social science 
	because it uses scientific methods to build theories that can help explain the  
	behaviour of individuals, groups and organisations. Economics attempts to explain <em>
	economic</em> behaviour, which arises when scarce resources are exchanged.
	</p>
	<p>
		In terms of methodology, economists, like other 
		social scientists, 
		are not able to undertake controlled experiments in the way that 
		chemists and biologists are. Hence, economists have to employ different 
		methods, based primarily on observation 
		and deduction and the construction of abstract models.
	</p>
	<p>
		As the social sciences have evolved over the last 100 years, they have become increasingly specialised. 
		This is true for economics, as witnessed by the development of 
		many different strands of investigation including <em>micro</em> and <em>macro</em> economics, 
		<em>pure</em> and <em>applied</em> economics, and <em>industrial</em> and 
		<em>financial</em> economics. What links them all is the attempt to understand how and why 
		exchange takes place, and how exchange creates benefits and costs for the 
		participants.

	<h2>The study of economics</h2>
</div>
	<p>
		The study of economics involves three related 
		investigations. 
	</p>
<ol>
	<li>Why scarce resources are exchanged?</li>
	<li>
		How consumers and producers behave as they interact with each other in markets, in their attempt to achieve mutually beneficial exchange?
	</li>
	<li>
	The role of 
	government in compensating for the limitations of markets in achieving 
	mutually beneficial exchange?
	</li>
</ol>
